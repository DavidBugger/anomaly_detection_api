1. Set Up Google Cloud Identity
Go to Google Cloud Console.
Navigate to Identity > Cloud Identity.
If you haven't already done so, set up Cloud Identity for your domain. This will allow you to manage users, groups, and access controls.
2. Integrate with Google Cloud Directory
Create or Configure Directory:
Ensure your organizationâ€™s domain is verified and linked with Google Cloud Identity.
Create user accounts within the Google Cloud Directory.
Access Cloud Directory APIs:
Enable the Cloud Identity API:
gcloud services enable cloudidentity.googleapis.com
Use this API to manage users and perform operations such as listing users, verifying user details, and managing group memberships.
3. Create and Configure Service Account
Create a service account to allow your API to interact with Google Cloud services securely:
gcloud iam service-accounts create anomaly-api-service \
  --description="Service account for anomaly detection API" \
  --display-name="Anomaly Detection API Service Account"
Grant the required roles to the service account to manage Active Directory integration:
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding your-project-id \
  --member="serviceAccount:anomaly-api-service@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/admin"
4. Configure OAuth 2.0 Authentication
Go to APIs & Services > Credentials.
Create OAuth 2.0 Client IDs for your web app.
Download the credentials JSON file and store it securely in your project directory.
Use libraries like google-auth to authenticate API calls:
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from google.auth.transport.requests import Request

# Load credentials from the JSON key file
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
    'path/to/credentials.json',
    scopes=['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-identity']
)

# Use the credentials to make authenticated requests
credentials.refresh(Request())
